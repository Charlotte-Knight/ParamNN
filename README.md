# ParamNN

Replicating the results of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.07913.pdf).

So far I have replicated the toy example. I am now moving on to the high-dimensional physical example.

To use the code, first setup and enter the environment with:
```
./setup_env.sh
source env/bin/activate
```

Running [toyExample.py](toyExample.py) will output plots similar to those found in the paper.
